#Two of them are administrators (A and E)
#I checked the ability to make transfers to blocked and unblocked users, I checked if the transfer scale is correct and if you can send more money than we have on the account, whether you can send negative amounts, I checked if any error pops up when registering a new user (different passwords, same names)
